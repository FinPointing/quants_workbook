# UG Quants summative assessment: Interpreting Quantitative Findings Report

## Introduction

This is our final practical session. Today, we will be discussing some practical aspects of the summative assessment *Interpreting Quantitative Findings Report*. You will actually get started by creating a template you can use to write your assignment in RStudio. Also, you will get familiar with the structure and the contents of the template. Remember, this is the perfect time for clarifying as much questions as possible. Your tutor will be more than happy to help!

Before proceeding, please take about 10 minutes to read the instructions for the assignment available in Moodle.


## Create your research report template from GitHub

We created a GitHub repository which contains an RStudio project and all the essentials to start writing your report. There are two options for you. One is writing in **RStudio Cloud**, as we have been doing it along this course. Alternatively, you can also use the **RStudio Desktop** version (this requires having `R` and RStudio installed in your machine). The result will be the same and the process is very similar. So, the choice is totally up to your preferences. Here, we explain how to start your own project for both options. 

For this session, try only one of these. Don't worry about which one you choose now, you can change your mind later.

### RStudio Cloud version

If you wish to write your project using RStudio Cloud, please follow the next steps:

1. Access [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) as usual.
2. Make sure you are in your Quants lab group (not in 'Your Workspace').
3. Click on the 'New Project' button and select 'New Project from Git Repository'.
```{r fig.cap="New project from GitHub.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/research_rep_2.PNG")
```
4. Paste the following URL in the box and click 'OK': https://github.com/rafavdz/UGQuant-assignment2.
5. You are all set! Just click on the project to access the contents.

### RStudio Desktop version

If alternately you decide to write your assessment using the RStudio Desktop version, consider the following steps:

1. Access the following GitHub repository copying and pasting the following URL in your browser: <https://github.com/rafavdz/UGQuant-assignment2>.
2. Click on the 'Code' button and select the 'Download ZIP' option, as shown below.
```{r fig.cap="Downlowad ZIP from GitHub.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/research_rep_4.PNG")
```
3. Go to your local downloads folder, right click on the `UGQuant-assignment2-main.zip` and choose the 'Extract all' option (here, you can also chose the folder where you want to store the RStudio project and write your assignment). 
4. Click on the 'Extract' button.
5. As you can see, this folder contains an RStudio project. Open the `UGQuant-assignment2.Rproj` which will initialize a new RStudio session.


## About the research report template

Once in your **UGQuant-assignment2** project, open the `Assignmet2-template.Rmd` file in Pane 4 under the 'Files' tab, as shown below.

```{r fig.cap="Template.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/research_rep_3.PNG")
```

This template contains the following:

* Suggested structure of the report.
* Suggested word count for each section.
* The code necessary to run and present the results of a multivariate linear regression.

In essence, this is the basic structure to start writing your assignment. Of course, you can add, edit, and customize as much as you consider it appropriate. Remember, this is just a generic suggestion and you should still address all the points to the best of your abilities. It is your time to shine!


## Activity 1

1. In the template, fill in the 'author' and 'date' space in the YALM at the top of the file with your student number and appropriate information using quotation marks.
2. Knit the `Rmd` file as `html` (RStudio will ask to install some packages, click 'Yes').
3. In the output, look at the results of the table under the 'Results' section and identify the *dependent* and the *independent* variables. You can learn about the meaning of these variables in the NILT documentation ([click here to access the documentation](https://www.ark.ac.uk/teaching/NILT2012TeachingResources.pdf)).
4. Identify the variables that are significant in this model and the direction of the relationship.
5. Discuss your interpretations with your neighbour or tutor. You can refer back to [Lab 8](#simple-lm) and [Lab 9](#multi-lm) to refresh your memory.

## Activity 2

1. Write one introductory paragraph in the 'Introduction' section of the template according to the guidance provided and your preliminary insights.
2. Knit the document again.


## Conclusion 

You are on the right track now!

We hope that by getting familiar with this setting, you will easily succeed in writing your research report using all the knowledge and skills acquired during this course. Take this session to ask as much question as possible. This is the right time to have specialized one-to-one support from your tutor.

We wish you the best of luck!
